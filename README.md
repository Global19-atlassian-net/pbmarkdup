<p align="center">Mark duplicate reads from PacBio sequencing of an amplified library</p>

***

_pbmarkdup_ takes one or multiple sequencing chips of an amplified libray as
HiFi reads and marks or removes duplicates.

## Availability
Latest `pbmarkdup` can be installed via bioconda package `pbmarkdup`.

Please refer to our [official pbbioconda page](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda)
for information on Installation, Support, License, Copyright, and Disclaimer.

## Latest Version
Version **0.2.0**: [Full changelog here](#changelog)

## Execution
**Input**: HiFi reads from one or multiples movies in PacBio BAM (`.ccs.bam`),
PacBio dataset (`.consensusreadset.bam`), file of file names (`.fofn`),
FASTQ (optionally gzipped), or FASTA (optionally gzipped) format.

**Output**: HiFi reads with duplicates marked in a format inferred from the
file extension: HiFi BAM (`.bam`); FASTQ (`.fastq`); FASTQ (`.fasta`);
bgzipped FASTQ (`.fastq.gz`); bgzipped FASTA (`.fasta.gz`); or SMRT Link XML
(`.consensusreadset.xml`) which also generates a corresponding BAM file.

Run on a single movie:

    pbmarkdup movie.ccs.bam output.bam

Run on multiple movies

    pbmarkdup movie1.fasta movie2.fasta output.fasta

Run on multiple movies and output duplicates in separate file

    pbmarkdup movie1.ccs.bam movie2.fastq uniq.fastq --dup-file dups.fasta

## FAQ

### Does _pbmarkdup_ work on my CLR data?
No. The purpose of this tool to mark PCR duplicates for amplicon HiFi libraries
after CCS calling.

### How are duplicates marked?
Duplicates have annotated read names in FASTA and FASTQ; FASTA example

    >m64013_191117_050515/67104/ccs DUPLICATE=m64013_191117_050515/3802014/ccs DS=2

shows a marked duplicate read `m64013_191117_050515/67104/ccs` that is a duplicate
of `m64013_191117_050515/3802014/ccs` and the this molecule has been sequenced
`2` times. Accordingly, the read that has been selected as the representative
of the molecule:

    >m64013_191117_050515/3802014/ccs DS=2

In BAM format, tags `ds:i:` provides the number of reads of this molecule and
`du:Z:` the name of the representative read.

### Can I print summary information
Yes, use `--log-level INFO` and get following summary:

```
LIBRARY         READS    UNIQUE MOLECULES    DUPLICATE READS
----------  ----------  ------------------  -----------------
<Unnamed>        25000       24948 (99.8%)          52 (0.2%)
SS-lib             496         493 (99.4%)           3 (0.6%)
----------  ----------  ------------------  -----------------
TOTAL            25496       25441 (99.8%)          55 (0.2%)
```

For each library, BAM `@RG` library tag `LB` or `<Unnamed>` for FASTA/Q input,
number and percentages of unique and duplicate reads are listed per row.

### Can I mark duplicates across different libraries?
Use `--cross-library` to mark agnostic of library names.

### Can I store duplicates in an extra file?
Use `--dup-file FILE` to store duplicates in an extra file. The format of this
file can be different to the output file.

### Can I remove duplicates?
Use `--rmdup`.

### Why are input files parsed twice?
In order to keep memory footprint to a minimum, we trade reading input files
twice instead of storing everything in memory. The goal was to support
processing multiple movies with a standard server.

### What input / output combinations are allowed

Input as rows, outputs as columns:

| IN/OUT  | BAM | DATASET | FASTQ | FASTA |
| ------- | :-: | :-----: | :---: | :---: |
| BAM     | x   | x       | x     | x     |
| DATASET | x   | x       | x     | x     |
| FASTQ   |     |         | x     | x     |
| FASTA   |     |         |       | x     |

Allowed combination example:

    pbmarkdup movie1.ccs.bam movie2.fastq movie3.fasta out.fasta

Forbidden combination example:

    pbmarkdup movie2.fastq movie3.fasta out.fastq

### Is there a progress report?
Yes. With `--log-level INFO`, _pbmarkdup_ provides status to `stderr`.
