***

_pbmarkdup_ takes one or multiple sequencing chips of an amplified libray as
HiFi reads and marks or removes duplicates.

## Availability
Latest `pbmarkdup` can be installed via bioconda package `pbmarkdup`.

Please refer to our [official pbbioconda page](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda)
for information on Installation, Support, License, Copyright, and Disclaimer.

## Latest Version
Version **0.2.0**: [Full changelog here](#changelog)

## Execution
**Input**: HiFi reads from one or multiples movies in PacBio BAM (`.ccs.bam`),
PacBio dataset (`.consensusreadset.bam`), file of file names (`.fofn`),
FASTQ (optionally gzipped), or FASTA (optionally gzipped) format.

**Output**: HiFi reads with duplicates marked in a format inferred from the
file extension: HiFi BAM (`.bam`); FASTQ (`.fastq`); FASTQ (`.fasta`);
bgzipped FASTQ (`.fastq.gz`); bgzipped FASTA (`.fasta.gz`); or SMRT Link XML
(`.consensusreadset.xml`) which also generates a corresponding BAM file.

Run on a full movie:

    pbmarkdup movie.ccs.bam output.bam

Run on multiple movies

    pbmarkdup movie1.fasta movie2.fasta output.fasta

Run on multiple movies and output duplicates in separate file

    pbmarkdup movie1.ccs.bam movie2.fastq uniq.fastq --dup-file dups.fasta

## FAQ

### Why are input files parsed twice?
In order to keep memory footprint to a minimum, we trade reading input files
twice instead of storing everything in memory. The goal was to support
processing multiple movies with a standard server.

### What input / output combinations are allowed

Input as rows, outputs as columns:

| IN/OUT  | BAM | DATASET | FASTQ | FASTA |
| ------- | :-: | :-----: | :---: | :---: |
| BAM     | x   | x       | x     | x     |
| DATASET | x   | x       | x     | x     |
| FASTQ   |     |         | x     | x     |
| FASTA   |     |         |       | x     |

Allowed combination example:

    pbmarkdup movie1.ccs.bam movie2.fastq movie3.fasta out.fasta

Forbidden combination example:

    pbmarkdup movie2.fastq movie3.fasta out.fastq

### Is there a progress report?
Yes. With `--log-level INFO`, _pbmarkdup_ provides status to `stderr`.
